_bashmenot-website_
===================

Website for _bashmenot_.

This is a fork to get (barely) functional documentation of [_bashmenot_](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/tree/master/bashmenot) in form of a website because the [original website](https://bashmenot.mietek.io/) is no longer accessible.

- See updated [_bashmenot_ reference](https://cbhushan.github.io/bashmenot-website/pages/reference/) for a complete list of available functions and options.

- Read the [_bashmenot_ source code](https://github.com/mietek/bashmenot) to understand how it works.
